Capstone Coding Project Description
====================================

For this project, you will be completing two outcomes for this course:

- *CS30-CAP1* Create a large-scale computer program to demonstrate proficiency in procedural or object-oriented programming.
- *CS30-CAP2* Reflect on and document the process of creating a large-scale computer program.

Project Overview
------------------

- Choose a project that is of an appropriate scale and complexity based on the skills and abilities of team members.
- Identify required (must have) features and desired (nice to have) features of the project.
- Create a project proposal that includes the basic premise, required features (must have list), desired features (nice to have list) and project team (e.g., individual, pairs or larger group).
- Incorporate programming concepts and principles such as data structures, external files, libraries and/or object-oriented programming as required.
- Develop and revise project documents such as team member tasks and/or milestone timeline.
- Develop elegant code and refine through multiple iterations.
- Commit project code to GitHub each day that we have project work time during class (or more frequently, if desired).
- Integrate code from multiple team members as required.
- Conduct beta testing with peers and/or external participants as required, and record the results (either in a separate file, or as inline comments).
- Incorporate feedback from peers and/or external participants as required.
- Revise the scale and complexity of the project according to skill, available resources and available time.
- Confirm that the project incorporates all required features.
- Identify how specific programming challenges were resolved.
- Present completed capstone project to peers and/or external participants.


Evaluation
-----------

Proposal 
    - Includes "need to have" and "nice to have" list
    - 5 marks

Daily GitHub Commit History 
    - Can see progress over time with commits
    - 5 marks

GitHub Commit Summary Comments
    - Commit summary comments describe the progress made. Can easily tell what has been accomplished in a commit
    - 5 marks

Time Management 
    - Used all class time wisely
    - 10 marks

Coding Conventions

    - 5 marks

Internal Documentation
    - Includes comment header and code is well commented (not too much, not too little)
    - 10 marks

Functionality 
    - All "need to have" functionality has been implemented
    - 15 marks

Use of Ideas Learned in CS30 
    - Incorporate ideas such as data structures (arrays, maps), external files, libraries and/or object-oriented programming as required
    - 15 marks

Presentation of project to class
    - 6 to 8 minute presentation to the class on your project. Excellent presentation, showing both what you did and how you did it. Talks about challenges they encountered throughout the project
    - 10 marks

Beta Testing 
    - Testing was conducted and is documented in a beta-testing.md file
    - 5 marks

Reflection 
    - Answer questions like the following: 
    - what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
    - did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
    - What was the hardest part of the project?
    - Were there any problems you could not solve?
    - 5 marks

WOW ME factor 
    - What did you do to go "above and beyond" the basics?
    - 10 marks

Total Marks: 100
