Capstone Coding Project Exemplars
====================================

You may want to take a look at some of the following projects, which were created by students taking this course over the past few years. A few notes things you might want to consider:

- some of the more complicated/impressive projects were started near the beginning of the semester, and worked on throughout the semester
- some projects have better variable naming conventions, whitespace, comments, meaningful commit messages, etc. than others
