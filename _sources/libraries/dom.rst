p5.dom Library
========================

This library can be quite tricky to use, but does provide some really interesting use cases. Although we may not actually explore this in class, you are welcome to check it out on your own.

Installing a Library
---------------------

Since the p5.dom library is part of the default template, all we have to do is link to it in our HTML file.

Your HTML file might look something like this:

.. code-block:: html

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <script src="js/p5.js">
        <script src="js/p5.dom.js">
        <script src="sketch.js">
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>
