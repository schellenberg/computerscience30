		<h1> Optical Illusions Part 1, For Loops</h1>
		<p> Write a program using dudraw to replicate any one of the optical illusions shown below (you choose). [Note to instructors: this can be modified to any language using most options for graphics packages.]
Modify the image in some way to make the image distinct from what is shown below (change colors, number of lines, thickness of lines, or any other modifications)</p>

		<p> Submit the project with the usual naming conventions for your file and the usual requirements for documentation (docstrings, comments and variable names). </p>

		<h3>Illusion 1: Gradient illusion</h3>
		<p>The background here is drawn with a gradient of gray colors ranging from a brightness of 0 to 255. But the rectangle in the middle is one rectangle of a mid-intensity gray, it does not have a color change in it!</p>

		<h3>Illusion 2: Curving squares (the 3 purplish shapes really are squares, they are not curved)</h3>

<p>
The following three choices may require trigonometry. In python, the  math.cos() and math.sin() functions accept the angle in radians as a parameter. The radiating lines are drawn from the center outwards are spaced with a constant angle between them.

		<h3>Illusion 3: Hering's illusion (the red lines are not curved, they are actually straight parallel lines</h3>

		<h3>Illusion 4: Eisenstein's illusion (the red shapes are a true circle and a true square. Their distorted appearance is an illusion.</h3>

		<h3> This is a recreation of a drawing called "Leviant Enigma". Most people see illusory motion or flow within the purple rings.</h3>
