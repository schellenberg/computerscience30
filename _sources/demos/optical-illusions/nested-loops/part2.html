		<h1> Optical Illusions Part 2, Nested Loop Assignment</h1>
		<p> Write a program using dudraw to replicate any one of the optical illusions shown below (you choose). [Note to instructors: this can be modified to any language using most options for graphics packages.]
Modify the image in some way to make the image distinct from what is shown below (change colors, number of lines, thickness of lines, or any other modifications)</p>

		<p> Submit the project with the usual naming conventions for your file and the usual requirements for documentation (docstrings and comments), </p>

		<h3>Illusion 1: Hermann Scintillating Grid Illusion (the black dots appearing in each white circle are illusory)</h3>

		<h3>Illusion 4: Skye Blue Cafe Wall Illusion (purple stripes are parallel.</h3>

 	<p>This is a simplified version of the stunning illusion created by Victoria Skye, which won the 2017 Illusion of the Year: (<a href="https://illusionoftheyear.com/2017/10/skye-blue-cafe-wall-illusion/">https://illusionoftheyear.com/2017/10/skye-blue-cafe-wall-illusion/</a>)</p>

		<h3> Illusion 5: Image of a cat, hidden with masking</h3>
		<p>To see the image, either drag the window, or. turn your head to move your eyes quickly across the screen. The image is created by using a background image, lightening it up significantly, and drawing a checkerboard of black squares on top of it. If you implement this illusion, upload a folder containing both your source code and your background image. This example was inspired by Akiyoshi Kitaoka's work. (His optical illusions webpage: <a href="https://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">https://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html</a>, and a twitter post showing his masking example: <a href="https://twitter.com/AkiyoshiKitaoka/status/980340277264003072">https://twitter.com/AkiyoshiKitaoka/status/980340277264003072</a></p>

		<h3>Illusion 6: Animated Gradient Illusion (The moving square is not changing color and is the same color as the other two gray squares.)</h3>

  <h3>Illusion 7: Walking Feet Illusion (the yellow and purple rectangles are moving smoothly with no pauses, and the purple rectangle is at all times directly aligned with the yellow rectangle)</h3>
  <p> This illusion was first demonstrated by Stuart Anstis (<a href="http://anstislab.ucsd.edu/illusions/footsteps/">http://anstislab.ucsd.edu/illusions/footsteps/</a>)
