.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Draw primative shapes in p5js. Explore storing color values.


Ideas from:
----------------

`Processing basic drawing tutorial <https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/>`_


`Processing color tutorial <https://p5js.org/learn/color.html>`_


To Remember
------------

- use keyTyped() instead of keyPressed()  **in keyTyped(), the key variable is case sensitive!**
- can return false; to override default behaviour of that key (like space key scrolling...)


Create a sketch to make the following happen:

	- when the mouse is on the left-hand side of your screen, rectangles should be drawn (all over the screen). The rectangles should be various shades of grey.

	- when the mouse is on the right-hand side of the screen, circles should still be drawn all over the screen (in random colours).
