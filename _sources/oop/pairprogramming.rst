Pair Programming with OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
========================================================

Given the :download:`following starter code <../handouts/oop-starter-code.zip>`, work with a partner to fill in the methods for the Ship class. You should use booleans to allow the ship to move "nicely" (without stuttering when you press a new key). 

Extensions
-----------

If you finish early, you should fill in the Bullet class as well. When the space key is pressed, send a bullet flying "up" the screen. 

For those that complete this, instead of a single Bullet, create a Bullet array, so that you can fire multiple bullets at the same time. Try to figure out how you would deal with bullets that are off screen.
