Selection Sort
===============

Use the visualization below to figure out how selection sort works.

Visualization
---------------

`Check out the sorting visualizer here <https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html>`_ 


Pencil and Paper Practice
--------------------------

On a piece of paper, show the iterations done by selection sort for the list {5,15,3,8,9,1,20,7} 


Code the Algorithm
-------------------

See if you can implement an algorithm for selection sort. You may want to begin by adapting the bubble sort code you created.
