Capstone Coding Project Description
====================================

For this project, you will be completing two outcomes for this course:

- *CS30-CAP1* Create a large-scale computer program to demonstrate proficiency in procedural or object-oriented programming.
- *CS30-CAP2* Reflect on and document the process of creating a large-scale computer program.

Project Overview
------------------

- Choose a project that is of an appropriate scale and complexity based on the skills and abilities of team members.
- Identify required (must have) features and desired (nice to have) features of the project.
- Create a project proposal that includes the basic premise, required features (must have list), desired features (nice to have list) and project team (e.g., individual, pairs or larger group).
- Incorporate programming concepts and principles such as data structures, external files, libraries and/or object-oriented programming as required.
- Develop and revise project documents such as team member tasks and/or milestone timeline.
- Develop elegant code and refine through multiple iterations.
- Commit project code to GitHub each day that we have project work time during class (or more frequently, if desired).
- Integrate code from multiple team members as required.
- Conduct beta testing with peers and/or external participants as required, and record the results (either in a separate file, or as inline comments).
- Incorporate feedback from peers and/or external participants as required.
- Revise the scale and complexity of the project according to skill, available resources and available time.
- Confirm that the project incorporates all required features.
- Identify how specific programming challenges were resolved.
- Present completed capstone project to peers and/or external participants.
