Loading External Files
========================

Important Functions to Know
----------------------------

- `loadStrings() <https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadStrings>`_ to load a text file as an array of strings (one line per element)
- either the `split() <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split>`_ method or `spread syntax <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#94a3>`_ to convert a string into an array of characters


First Demo
----------------

Adapt the grid example to load a predefined 2D array (just defined as a variable in the code). Now convert that into a text file, removing all the square brackets and commas. Load the file in your sketch, and either convert each element into a number, or change the grid code to work with string characters.
