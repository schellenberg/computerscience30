Reeborg Redux
=============================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Use JavaScript to solve a few Reeborg programming problems.


.. warning:: Although you can use Reeborg with JavaScript, the naming conventions of the built in functions and conditionals follow the underscore_naming_style (since it is primarily aimed at learning Python). Even though we will use camelCaseVariableNamingConvention for the rest of the course, you can use whatever you'd like for these practice problems.


Using JavaScript Mode
----------------------

To solve the following practice problems, be sure to select JavaScript mode if it doesn't happen automatically, as shown in the image below.

Step 9
------------------------

Open `Step 9 <https://reeborg.cs20.ca/?lang=en&mode=javascript&menu=%2Fworlds%2Fmenus%2Fsk_menu.json&name=Step%209&url=worlds%2Fsk%2Fstep9.json>`_ and write a JavaScript solution to pick up all flowers that appear, and put them all down in the 2,3 location, then move to the flag to finish the challenge. You will need to use two ``for`` loops, and one ``while`` loop. Your solution should look something like this:

Step 13
------------------------

Open `Step 13 <https://reeborg.cs20.ca/?lang=en&mode=javascript&menu=%2Fworlds%2Fmenus%2Fsk_menu.json&name=Step%2013&url=worlds%2Fsk%2Fstep13.json>`_ and write a JavaScript solution to move to the flag, jumping over any hurdles that are in the way. Create a function called ``turnRight()`` as part of your solution. Remember that `!` means NOT in JavaScript. Your solution should look something like this:

Step 16
------------------------

Open `Step 16 <https://reeborg.cs20.ca/?lang=en&mode=javascript&menu=%2Fworlds%2Fmenus%2Fsk_menu.json&name=Step%2016&url=worlds%2Fsk%2Fstep16.json>`_ and write a JavaScript solution to pick up all of the carrots that might appear on the ground. Create a function called ``harvestColumn()`` as part of your solution. You will need to use three ``for`` loops and one ``while`` loop. Your solution should look something like this:
