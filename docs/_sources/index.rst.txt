Computer Science 30 - Schellenberg
----------------------------------

.. warning:: This is just a place for me to house content for my students while we experiment with using `p5js <https://p5js.org/>`_ in our Comp Sci 30 course. I'm not creating it to be suitable for others to use, but rather just a testing ground for my course.


.. note:: To students: You can (and will) find a lot of outdated JavaScript tutorials on the web. Because JavaScript tries really hard to "work" no matter what, there are many things that work, but are not best practice. The biggest thing you need to keep in mind is that we won't ever use the ``var`` keyword (use ``let`` instead).


.. things i need to add throughout:
..   CP1 d) Refactor existing code to increase elegance
..   CP1 e) Critique third party code (e.g., student, teacher or textbook programs) and make suggestions for improvement

    You can `download a copy of our p5js template folder <https://github.com/schellenberg/cs30-p5js-template/archive/master.zip>`_, extract the .zip file, then make/download a copy of this each time you are creating a new project.

Helpful Links
::::::::::::::

- `p5js Reference <https://p5js.org/reference/>`_ -- explains all the p5js functions available to you
- `The Coding Train Tutorials <http://thecodingtrain.com/Tutorials/>`_ -- great stuff from Daniel Shiffman
- `MDN JavaScript Web Docs <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>`_ -- general JavaScript help (not p5js specific)
- `Open Game Art <https://opengameart.org/>`_ -- provides a variety of high quality, freely licensed art, so that free/open source game developers can use it in their games
- `Collision Detection Library <https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D>`_ -- p5.collide2D provides tools for calculating collision detection for 2D geometry with p5.js
- `The Nature of Code <https://natureofcode.com/book/>`_ -- Goes beyond what we do in class. Written in Processing, not p5js, so you need to do a bit of code conversion. Ask me for help, if needed.
- `Eloquent JavaScript book <https://eloquentjavascript.net/3rd_edition/>`_ -- though I will not follow all the same conventions, it's a good read
