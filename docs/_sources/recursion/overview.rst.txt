Recursion Explanation and Demos
==================================

Simply put, recursion is a function that calls itself.

Refresh your memory of factorials. Define factorials recursively (math, then code).

Practice problems from `CodingJS Recursion-1 <https://codingjs.wmcicompsci.ca/>`_ section. Be sure to do at least the following:

- `factorial <https://codingjs.wmcicompsci.ca/exercise.html?name=factorial&title=Recursion-1>`_ 
- `bunnyEars <https://codingjs.wmcicompsci.ca/exercise.html?name=bunnyEars&title=Recursion-1>`_ 
- `fibonacci <https://codingjs.wmcicompsci.ca/exercise.html?name=fibonacci&title=Recursion-1>`_ 
- `triangle <https://codingjs.wmcicompsci.ca/exercise.html?name=triangle&title=Recursion-1>`_ 
- `bunnyEars2 <https://codingjs.wmcicompsci.ca/exercise.html?name=bunnyEars2&title=Recursion-1>`_ 


Sierpinski Triangle
--------------------

Make a Sierpinski triangle drawing program in p5. 

.. image::  images/sierpinski-triangle.gif

Key ideas:

- use an object to hold point data (x and y coordinates)
- have a function that calculates the midpoint between two coordinates, and returns the resulting coordinate
- create a sierpinski(points, degree) recursive function. Use the degree as both the exit clause, as well as the index value to select a fill color from a list of colors


Fractal Circles
----------------

`Check out the demo here <https://p5js.org/examples/structure-recursion.html>`_.


Fractal Tree
-------------

If students are interested in another demo, build something like this `Coding Train fractal tree demo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU>`_.

Extensions
-----------

Maze generator demo (already have a version built in my demos folder...). Warning -- This is a much more involved/challenging demo.
